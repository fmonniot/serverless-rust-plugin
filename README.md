# serverless-rust

A Serverless framework plugin for Rust applications

TODO Badges

<hr>

An inspired −somewhat forked− plugin from the awesome [softprops/serverless-rust](https://github.com/softprops/serverless-rust).

Why new plugin:
- No custom runtime (deprecated)
- No assumptions on what the zip archive contains
- Use native cross compilation by default (perhaps offer cross as an alternative)

TODO this readme :)
